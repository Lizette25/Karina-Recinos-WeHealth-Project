# Karina-Recinos-WeHealth-Project
Brief Introduction: Welcome to my project! I worked with WeHealth to gather information on health care systems. The goal of this project was to make health information easily accessible to the public. Here, you will find access to my work and see the progress I’ve made while working on this project.

The health resource crawler analyzes a health-related webpage. It extracts:

- Phone numbers

- Healthcare facility names

- Addresses

Details are stored in a JSON file. This file contains the information shown in the output summary.

**Features of the Program**

- Fetches and parses a webpage

- Detects contact information using regex patterns

- Uses keyword auto-tagging

- Identifies healthcare facilities

**Project Setup**

- Python 3.14 or IDLE 3.14

- Stable internet connection

**Installation Package Requirements**

Go to your computer’s command terminal and run:
- bash

- pip install beautifulsoup4 lxml requests


All details are stored in an output folder within your computer’s file explorer.
This output folder contains a JSON file titled “test_single_site.json.”
