This document contains information on websites that were used for crawling

**Websites**
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/testing/index.html
https://health.ucsd.edu/
**Notes**
- I crawled two websites: CDC and UCSD Health
- All data that was collected came from publicly available health information pages 
- The pages do not require logins or authentications
- Crawler is respectful of rate limits
- Crawler retrieved content from HTML text
- The crawler extracts phone numbers, addresses, and facility names 
- The crawler is ethical in the sense that it does not bypass restrictions 

**Refresh/update strategy**
- Fetches a targeted page and generates a new JSON file each time. For example, if I input the CDC web page, it will grab content from that specific page and generate a JSON file. If I input the UCSD web page, it’ll fetch content from that page and generate a JSON file specific to that page.
- This ensures that data reflects current information 
- Output file is timestamped
